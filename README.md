# page-O-builder

This repo contains a page builder that can be easily implemented in your own website.

### The idea of this project

If you create your own blog page, you can already do a lot with a WYSIWYG text editor, but a page builder is simply missing to make the website a bit prettier.

This page builder does not want to be a jack of all trades, but offers the basic functions and more, with which you can already design a lot of your (blog) page.

Basic knowledge of CSS for working with the page-o-builder is an advantage.
